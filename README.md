# Stock-IT
In this project our goal is to design a comprehensive tool for stock data analysis and prediction. In our project, we have implemented 5 major components. We have the user interface (UI), data analysis/machine learning, data storage, earnings call transcript analysis, data streaming with Kafka, and machine learning with Spark. For our UI we are using streamlit to implement a simple user interface that is very easy to follow for a non-technical user. In our interface we have given the option of uploading a stock trading csv file for a company or the user can choose one of the pre-loaded companies and view their analysis without having to upload anything. Our data, user’s data, and the result of machine learning models are stored in the firestore. For the machine learning aspect of our project we are utilizing Facebook’s Prophet procedure which enables us to predict the closing, low, and high price of stocks in the future. In addition, we are utilizing spark and Spark Mlib for three different regression types, which gives additional power to the user on stock price prediction. We also support live data streaming for the top S&P 500 stocks, and earnings call transcript analysis.
